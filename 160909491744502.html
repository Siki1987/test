Temperatures fall through the 40s and into the 30s. <br>{\/p}<p><strong>Overnight{\/strong}: Mostly clear. Low: 32.{\/p}<p><strong>Wednesday{\/strong}: Becoming mostly cloudy with showers returning late. Windy and warm. High: 54{\/p}<p>Good afternoon! It was great to see the sun again! And with that sun, temperatures made it into the lower to middle 40s Tuesday afternoon. We'll see mainly clear skies this evening as we fall back from the 40s and into the 30s. Don't forget about the Great Conjunction. Tonight will likely be your last night to see it. Even though it peaked last night, Jupiter and Saturn will still be really close together in the southwestern sky during the 6-7pm hour. Make sure you have a good view to the horizon and are away from city light pollution. While the two won't be quite a close as last night, to the naked eye it'll look nearly the same. High pressure controls our weather through the start of Wednesday before a powerful cold front moves closer by the end of the day and that brings back showers. But before they get here, we'll climb as high as the middle 50s Wednesday and winds will also get gusty - perhaps gusting over 30 mph at times. Rain will continue through Wednesday night but begin to mix with and change to snow Thursday morning as the cold front arrives. This front will send temperatures plummeting Thursday from an early morning high in the middle 30s down into the 20s. Right now the best chance of picking up any measurable snow will be along and east of I-75 with our far eastern counties perhaps picking up a solid inch or better. Areas west of I-75 have a much lower chance of seeing measurable snowfall, but a little still may stick to elevated or grassy surfaces. By Christmas morning, we'll be down into the teens and we'll need to watch for slick spots starting Thursday night, especially on elevated roads because those road temperatures will dip quickly. Flurries and snow showers will make it look like Christmas Friday with any additional accumulations under an inch. It'll also feel like Christmas with wind chills near zero in the morning and only in the teens by the afternoon. Actual highs only top out in the lower 20s on Friday. Things get warmer by the weekend. Join me and Meteorologist Erica Collura for Local 12 News starting First at Four and again at 5, 5:30 and 6 with more on the dramatic changes coming this week.
